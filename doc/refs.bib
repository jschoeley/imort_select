  abstract = {The widely-known Gompertz law of mortality states the exponential increase of mortality with age in human populations. Such an exponential increase is observed at the adulthood span, roughly after the reproductive period, while mortality data at young and extremely old ages deviate from it. The heterogeneity of human populations, i.e. the existence of subpopulations with different mortality dynamics, is a useful consideration that can explain age-dependent mortality patterns across the whole life-course. A simple mathematical model combining the heterogeneity of populations with an assumption that the mortality in each subpopulation grows exponentially with age has been proven to be capable of reproducing the entire mortality pattern in a human population including the observed peculiarities at early- and late-life intervals. In this work we fit this model to actual (Swedish) mortality data for consecutive periods and consequently describe the evolution of mortality dynamics in terms of the evolution of the model parameters over time. We have found that the evolution of the model parameters validates the applicability of the compensation law of mortality to each subpopulation separately. Furthermore, our study has indicated that the population structure changes so that the population tends to become more homogeneous over time. Finally, our analysis of the decrease of the overall mortality in a population over time has shown that this decrease is mainly due to a change in the population structure and to a lesser extent to a reduction of mortality in each of the subpopulations, the latter being represented by an alteration of the parameters that outline the exponential dynamics.},

It has been verified for many non-human species in ecology, and recently, for Norway's human population. In this article, we test TL for human mortality. Methods: We use death counts and exposures by single age (0 to 100) and calendar year (1960 to 2009) for countries of the Human Mortality Database to compute death rates as well as their rates of change in time. For both mortality measures, we test temporal forms of TL: In cross-age-scenarios, we analyze temporal variance to mean relationships at different ages in a certain country, and in cross-country-scenarios, we analyze temporal variance to mean relationships in different countries at a certain age. Results: The results reveal almost log-linear variance to mean relationships in both scenarios; exceptions are the cross-country-scenarios for the death rates, which appear to be clustered together, due to similar mortality levels among the countries. Conclusions: TL appears to describe a regular pattern in human mortality. We suggest that it might be used (1) in mortality forecasting (to evaluate the quality of forecasts and to justify linear mortality assumptions) and (2) to reveal minimum mortality at some ages.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The 10-point Apgar score has been used to assess the condition and prognosis of newborn infants throughout the world for almost 50 years. Some investigators have proposed that measurement of pH in umbilical-artery blood is a more objective method of assessing newborn infants. METHODS We carried out a retrospective cohort analysis of 151,891 live-born singleton infants without malformations who were delivered at 26 weeks of gestation or later at an inner-city public hospital between January 1988 and December 1998. Paired Apgar scores and umbilical-artery blood pH values were determined for 145,627 infants to assess which test best predicted neonatal death during the first 28 days after birth. RESULTS For 13,399 infants born before term (at 26 to 36 weeks of gestation), the neonatal mortality rate was 315 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3, as compared with 5 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 7 to 10. For 132,228 infants born at term (37 weeks of gestation or later), the mortality rate was 244 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3, as compared with 0.2 per 1000 for infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 7 to 10. The risk of neonatal death in term infants with five-minute Apgar scores of 0 to 3 (relative risk, 1460; 95 percent confidence interval, 835 to 2555) was eight times the risk in term infants with umbilical-artery blood pH values of 7.0 or less (relative risk, 180; 95 percent confidence interval, 97 to 334). CONCLUSIONS The Apgar scoring system remains as relevant for the prediction of neonatal survival today as it was almost 50 years ago.},

  abstract = {Background: Taylor's law (TL) states a linear relationship on logarithmic scales between the variance and the mean of a nonnegative quantity. TL has been observed in spatiotemporal contexts for the population density of hundreds of species including humans. TL also describes temporal variation in human mortality in developed countries, but no explanation has been proposed. Objective: To understand why and to what extent TL describes temporal variation in human mortality, we examine whether the mortality models of Gompertz, Makeham, and Siler are consistent with TL. We also examine how strongly TL differs between observed and modeled mortality, between women and men, and among countries. Methods: We analyze how well each mortality model explains TL fitted to observed occurrence--exposure death rates by comparing three features: the log--log linearity of the temporal variance as a function of the temporal mean, the age profile, and the slope of TL. We support some empirical findings from the Human Mortality Database with mathematical proofs. Results: TL describes modeled mortality better than observed mortality and describes Gompertz mortality best. The age profile of TL is closest between observed and Siler mortality. The slope of TL is closest between observed and Makeham mortality. The Gompertz model predicts TL with a slope of exactly 2 if the modal age at death increases linearly with time and the parameter that specifies the growth rate of mortality with age is constant in time. Observed mortality obeys TL with a slope generally less than 2. An explanation is that, when the parameters of the Gompertz model are estimated from observed mortality year by year, both the modal age at death and the growth rate of mortality with age change over time. Conclusions: TL describes human mortality well in developed countries because their mortality schedules are approximated well by classical mortality models, which we have shown to obey TL. Contribution: We provide the first theoretical linkage between three classical demographic models of mortality and TL.},

  abstract = {Today, we know that demographic rates can be greatly influenced by differences among individuals in their capacity to survive and reproduce. These intrinsic differences, commonly known as individual heterogeneity, can rarely be measured and are thus treated as latent variables when modeling mortality. Finite mixture models and mixed effects models have been proposed as alternative approaches for inference on individual heterogeneity in mortality. However, in general models assume that individual heterogeneity influences mortality proportionally, which limits the possibility to test hypotheses on the effect of individual heterogeneity on other aspects of mortality such as ageing rates. Here, we propose a Bayesian model that builds upon the mixture models previously developed, but that facilitates making inferences on the effect of individual heterogeneity on mortality parameters other than the baseline mortality. As an illustration, we apply this framework to the Gompertz--Makeham mortality model, commonly used in human and wildlife studies, by assuming that the Gompertz rate parameter is affected by individual heterogeneity. We provide results of a simulation study where we show that the model appropriately retrieves the parameters used for simulation, even for low variances in the heterogeneous parameter. We then apply the model to a dataset on captive chimpanzees and on a cohort life table of 1751 Swedish men, and show how model selection against a null model (i.e., without heterogeneity) can be carried out.},

Frailty models provide a powerful tool to analyse clustered survival data. In contrast to the large number of research publications on frailty models, relatively few statistical software packages contain frailty models. It is demanding for statistical practitioners and graduate students to grasp a good knowledge on frailty models from the existing literature. This book provides an in-depth discussion and explanation of the basics of frailty model methodology for such readers. The discussion includes parametric and semiparametric frailty models and accelerated failure time models. Common techniques to fit frailty models include the EM-algorithm, penalised likelihood techniques, Laplacian integration and Bayesian techniques. More advanced frailty models for hierarchical data are also included. Real-life examples are used to demonstrate how particular frailty models can be fitted and how the results should be interpreted. The programs to fit all the worked-out examples in the book are available from the Springer website with most of the programs developed in the freeware packages R and Winbugs. The book starts with a brief overview of some basic concepts in classical survival analysis, collecting what is needed for the reading on the more complex frailty models.},

A systematic way of describing heterogeneity is by an unobserved quantity called frailty, entering the hazard multiplicatively. Until now most studies have used a gamma distributed frailty, which is mathematically convenient; for example, the distribution among survivors is also gamma. This paper shows that several other distributions have equally simple properties, the main example being the inverse Gaussian distribution. Consequences of the different distributions are examined; the inverse Gaussian makes the population homogeneous with time, whereas for the gamma the relative heterogeneity is constant.},

At a certain time t0 a cross-sectional sample is taken, generating a sample of current durations (backward recurrence times) of survivors until t0 and a prevalent cohort study consisting of survival times left-truncated at the current durations. A Lexis diagram is helpful in visualizing this situation. Survival analysis based on current durations and prevalent cohort studies is now well-established as long as all covariates are observed. The general problems with unobserved covariates have been well understood for ordinary prospective follow-up studies, with the good help of hazard rate models incorporating frailties: as for ordinary regression models, the added noise generates attenuation in the regression parameter estimates. For prevalent cohort studies this attenuation remains, but in addition one needs to take account of the differential selection of the survivors from initiation t i to cross-sectional sampling at t0 . This paper intends to survey the recent development of these matters and the consequences for routine use of hazard rate models or accelerated failure time models in the many cases where unobserved heterogeneity may be an issue. The study was inspired by concrete problems in the study of time-to-pregnancy, and we present various simulation results inspired by this particular application.},

The field of evolutionary demography has long focused on understanding the evolution of senescence while largely failing to address the evolution of ontogenescence. The current review is the first to gather the few available hypotheses addressing the evolution of ontogenescence, examine the basis and assumptions of each and ask what the phylogenetic extent of ontogenescence may be. Ontogenescence is among the most widespread of life-history traits, occurring in every population for which I have found sufficiently detailed data, in major groups throughout the eukaryotes, across many causes of death and many life-history types. Hypotheses seeking to explain ontogenescence include those based on kin selection, the acquisition of robustness, heterogeneous frailties and life-history optimization. I propose a further hypothesis, arguing that mortality drops with age because most transitions that could trigger the risks caused by genetic and developmental malfunctions are concentrated in early life. Of these hypotheses, only those that frame ontogenescence as an evolutionary by-product rather than an adaptation can explain the tremendous diversity of organisms and environments in which it occurs.},

The extent to which gerontology needs to consider this U-shaped pattern of risk over age depends upon the mechanistic, demographic and evolutionary links and interactions between ontogenescence and senescence. In reading the literature on both senescence and ontogenescence, and in interacting with other biogerontologists, we have encountered a set of what we view as inaccurate or oversimplified claims about ontogenescence, its relationship to senescence and its importance to gerontology. Here, after briefly introducing ontogenescence, we address four of these claims. We demonstrate the counterfactual nature of Claim 1. Ontogenescence is an environmental effect largely absent in protected environments. We then briefly review the literature which leads to Claim 2. Senescence and ontogenescence are parts of the same phenomenon, and describe why we reject this view. We then explain why the rejection of Claim 2 does not necessarily support Claim 3, the idea that senescence and ontogenescence are easily separable. Finally, we examine Claim 4. Gerontologists don't need to think about ontogenescence, and give some examples of why we consider this misguided.},

Mortality plateaus result from multiplicative (proportional) and additive hazards, but not from accelerated failure time models. Frailty can have any distribution with regularly-varying-at-0 density and the distribution of frailty among survivors to each subsequent age converges to a gamma distribution. In a multiplicative setting the baseline cumulative hazard can be represented as the inverse of the negative logarithm of any completely monotone function. If the plateau is reached, the only meaningful solution at the plateau is provided by the gamma-Gompertz model.},

Medical records of 564 extremely low birth weight infants were reviewed retrospectively. The infants were grouped as survivors (group I), expired {$\leq$} 7\textsuperscript{t}\textsuperscript{h} postnatal day (group II), and expired {\textquestiondown} 7\textsuperscript{t}\textsuperscript{h} postnatal day (group III). The predictive value for mortality of gestational age, birth weight, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, clinical risk index for babies II score, and first and lowest serum albumin levels was assessed by calculating the associated area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The overall survival and mortality rates of groups I, II, and III were 81.0\% (457/564), 7.6\% (43/564), and 11.4\% (64/564), respectively. Birth weight, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, and first serum albumin levels were significantly higher, while the clinical risk index for babies II score was significantly lower in group I when compared to groups II and III. Gestational age and lowest serum albumin level in group I were significantly higher than group III, but not group II. However, gestational age, birth weight, and clinical risk index for babies II score showed gestational age dependent variations regardless of survival or mortality. Apgar score at 5 min (0.756) and lowest serum albumin level (0.771) demonstrated the highest AUC of the ROC curve in predicting mortality in group II and III, respectively. In conclusion, Apgar score at 5 min and lowest serum albumin level were the most effective predictors for mortality in extremely low birth weight infants during {$\leq$} 7\textsuperscript{t}\textsuperscript{h} and {\textquestiondown} 7\textsuperscript{t}\textsuperscript{h} postnatal days, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background. Risk-adjusted severity of illness is frequently used in clinical research and quality assessments. Although there are multiple methods designed for neonates, they have been infrequently compared and some have not been assessed in large samples of very low birth weight (VLBW; 1500 g) infants. Objectives. To test and compare published neonatal mortality prediction models, including Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB), Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP), SNAP-Perinatal Extension (SNAP-PE), Neonatal Therapeutic Interventions Scoring System, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) network model, and other individual admission factors such as birth weight, low Apgar score (7 at 5 minutes), and small for gestational age status in a cohort of VLBW infants from the Washington, DC area. Methods. Data were collected on 476 VLBW infants admitted to 8 neonatal intensive care units between October 1994 and February 1997. The calibration (closeness of total observed deaths to the predicted total) of models with published coefficients (SNAP-PE, CRIB, and NICHD) was assessed using the standardized mortality ratio. Discrimination was quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic curves. Calibrated models were derived for the current database using logistic regression techniques. Goodness-of-fit of predicted to observed probabilities of death was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results. The calibration of published algorithms applied to our data was poor. The standardized mortality ratios for the NICHD, CRIB, and SNAP-PE models were .65, .56, and .82, respectively. Discrimination of all the models was excellent (range: .863--.930). Surprisingly, birth weight performed much better than in previous analyses, with an AUC of .869. The best models using both 12- and 24-hour postadmission data, significantly outperformed the best model based on birth data only but were not significantly different from each other. The variables in the best model were birth weight, birth weight squared, low 5-minute Apgar score, and SNAP (AUC = .930). Conclusion. Published models for severity of illness overpredicted hospital mortality in this set of VLBW infants, indicating a need for frequent recalibration. Discrimination for these severity of illness scores remains excellent. Birth variables should be reevaluated as a method to control for severity of illness in predicting mortality.},

I accepted this formidable task because, I believe, it is the key idea of all the methods founded in the core of demography. Decomposition theory is based on the simple principle of separating demographic measures into components that contribute to an understanding of the phenomena under study. Most of the decompositions presented here refer to changes over time in demographic variables. For this reason, this research contributes to the understanding of population dynamics. The principle of decomposition methods is not only applicable to demography, however. All sciences, in one or other way, use decomposition as a research tool. As such, other social and natural sciences could benefit from the results presented in this book.},

  abstract = {The genetic variance of mortality rates in Drosophila melanogaster increases with age early in life, but declines at intermediate ages. A simulation study was done in order to evaluate two competing explanations for this age-specific pattern: (1) demographic heterogeneity, and (2) binomial sampling effects. The pattern can be explained by demographic heterogeneity among and within genotypes. In contrast, binomial sampling variance is not sufficient to explain this age-specific pattern of genetic variance in mortality rates. A previous publication that rejected the "heterogeneity explanation" in favor of binomial sampling is shown to be mistaken.},

The results imply that standard methods overestimate current life expectancy and potential gains in life expectancy from health and safety interventions, while underestimating rates of individual aging, past progress in reducing mortality, and mortality differentials between pairs of populations. Calculations based on Swedish mortality data suggest that these errors may be important, especially in old age.},

Standard analytical methods largely ignore this heterogeneity; the methods assume that all members of a population cohort at a given age face the same probability of death. This paper presents some mathematical methods for studying how the behavior over time of a heterogeneous cohort deviates from the behavior of the individuals that make up the cohort. The methods yield some startling results: individuals age faster than cohorts, eliminating a cause of death can decrease life expectancy, a cohort can suffer a higher death rate than another cohort even though its members have lower death rates, and cohort death rates can be increasing even though its members 'death rates are decreasing.},

Furthermore, because patterns at the individual level may be simpler than composite population patterns, both theoretical and empirical research may be unnecessarily complicated by failure to recognize the effects of heterogeneity.},

Here we prove that the change with age for the cohort equals the average of the change in the hazard for the individuals in the cohort minus the variance in the hazard across individuals. The variance captures the compositional change. This very general and remarkably elegant relationship can be applied to understand and to analyze changes with age in many kinds of demographic hazards, including, e.g., the lifetable aging rate or the intensity of first births.},

OBJECTIVE We present a list of important mathematical relationships that govern populations in which individuals differ from each other in unobserved ways. For some relationships we present proofs that, albeit formal, tend to be simple and intuitive. METHODS We organize the article in a progression, starting with general relationships and then turn- ing to models with stronger and stronger assumptions. RESULTS We start with the general case, in which we do not assume any structure of the underlying baseline hazard, the frailty distribution, or their link to one another. Then we sequentially assume, first, a relative-risk model; second, a gamma distribution for frailty; and, finally, a Gompertz and Gompertz-Makeham specification for baseline mortality. COMMENTS The article might serve as a handy overall reference to frailty models, especially for mor- tality research.},

The analysis of longitudinal data in aging studies now incorporates the notions of heterogeneity and frailty, as well as that of changes in the "repair capacity" of organisms. Furthermore, attention is now being paid to evolutionary theory and to models of senescence. These models and directions for further research are discussed.},
