#'---

#' In this research note I demonstrate various ways to estimate
#' the distribution of mortality risk in a population from individual level data.
#' I'll cover the techniques in order of increasing modelling complexity,
#' from purely descriptive to a full Bayesian probability model.
#'
#'## Data
#'
#' I use the "NCHS Cohort Linked Birth -- Infant Death Data Files" from the
#' *National Center for Health
#' Statistics*^[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm]. The
#' data set is a complete census of births and infant deaths on the territory of
#' the United States (without its overseas territories) and features most fields
#' present on the birth and death certificates. The size and detail of the data
#' allows to produce mortality estimates for thousands of sub-populations, and
#' thus the quantification of heterogeneity in perinatal mortality.
#'
#' The following strata contribute information about the distribution of
#' mortality risk in the population of newborns:
#'
#' - birthweight
#' - gestation at delivery
#' - 5 minute apgar score
#' - presence and severity of congenital anomalies
#' - plurality
#'
#' In order to increase the sample size I pool all data from the birth cohorts
#' 2005 to 2010.

#+ message=FALSE
library(tidyverse)
# set available memory to 100GB (important only on windows)
memory.limit(size = 100000)
# load microdata on births and infant deaths

    # we integrate additional information

    age_at_death_h =
      ifelse(age_at_death_d > 0,  # if death not at first day
             age_at_death_d*24, # convert age in days to hours
             # otherwise check if death happened in first hour
             # or hour 1-23 and code accordingly
             ifelse(age_at_death_c == '1-23 hours', 1, 0)),
    # so now we have interval censored data on the age at death in hours,
    # to deal with it we add the width of the age interval of death [x, x+nx)
    age_at_death_h_width = 24,
    age_at_death_h_width = ifelse(age_at_death_h == 0, 1, age_at_death_h_width),

    # perinatal death indicator, i.e. death during first hour of life

#'## The distribution of frailties
#'
#'Frailty is a measure of *relative risk* in a population. For a sub-population
#'$z$ I define frailty as
#'
#'$$
#'\zeta_z = \frac{\mu_z} {\bar\mu},
#'$$
#'
#'i.e. frailty is the stratum specific mortality rate scaled by the
#'population mortality rate. Therefore modelling the distribution of mortality
#'risk is equal to modelling the distribution of frailties scaled by $\bar\mu^{-1}$.
#'
#'### Empirical distribution functions
#'
#'How is the *observed* risk of death, as defined by the ratio of deaths to
#'exposures, distributed in a population? The empirical *distribution* of the
#'risk is given by the pair $(\mu_z, p_z)$, where $\mu_z$ is the observed
#'mortality rate in stratum $z$ and $p_z$ the proportion of the total population
#'exposure contributed by the individuals that stratum, i.e. $p_z$ expresses how
#'common the risk $\mu_z$ is in the total population. As $\sum_z p_z=1$ I can
#'define a probability mass function (PMF)
#'
#'$$
#'f_{\mu_z} = p_z.
#'$$
#'
#'In a case where two or more population strata have identical rates I collapse
#'the equal rates into single rate with a probability mass equal to the sum of
#'their exposures.
#'
#'#### Some summary statistics
#'
#' Most summary statistics have to be calculated with population exposures ($p_z$)
#' as *weights* as the mortality rates constitute observations on variably sized
#' groups of individuals.

range(lt_strat$nmx)
with(lt_strat, Hmisc::wtd.mean(nmx, px))
with(lt_strat, Hmisc::wtd.var(nmx, px, method = 'ML'))
with(lt_strat, Hmisc::wtd.quantile(nmx, px, type = 'i/n'))

#' From the summary statistics it is obvious that the data is
#' *spread over multiple magnitudes*, but with more than 75% of the population
#' experiencing a risk of less than 10 deaths per 1 million person hours of exposure
#' ($\mu_{q.75}=4.5e-6$). The average mortality rate $\bar\mu=9.4e-4$ is more
#' than 100 times higher than the median mortality ($\mu_{q.75}=4.5e-6$),
#' pointing towards a distribution of risk that is *extremely* skewed to the
#' right and therefore best analyzed on a *log-scale*.
#'
#'#### Dealing with 0 deaths
#'
#'There are quite a few cases with *0 observed deaths* (59.8% of all sub-groups
#'or 2.5% of the total population of birth feature zero deaths). The maximum
#'likelihood estimate for the death rate is 0 in such cases, such is the
#'ML-estimate for the probabililty of death. Because zero-risk is implausible
#'and can't be modelled on a log-scale I impute the zero mortality rates by an
#'alternative estimator for the risk of death. Quigley & Revie (2011) propose
#'$\hat{q} \approx \frac {1} {2.5n}$ as a point estimate for the probability of
#'death when 0 events out of $n$ trials have been observed.

#'### Spline-based density estimate

#'### Kernel-density estimate
#'
#'The Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is a non-parametric estimator of a random
#'variables probability density. Given observed mortality rates $\mu_z$ and
#'observed exposures $n_z$ I use the KDE to estimate a smooth density
#'distribution of mortality $\hat{f}_{\text{KDE}}(\mu_z)$.
#'
#'In order to facilitate the KDE
#'fit I model the distribution of the log transformed mortality instead.
#'The distribution of the $\mu_z$ is then recovered by evaluating
#'$\hat{f}_{\text{KDE}}(x=log(\mu_z))$ at $\exp(x)$.
#'
#'I fit the KDE to an empirical probability mass function (PMF) of observed,
#'0-adjusted mortality rates. To attain the PMF I aggregate multiple identical
#'observed mortality rates into a single point-mass at that rate with the mass
#'being the sum of the exposure times associated with each of the identcal
#'rates. I then divide the masses by the total exposure time of the population
#'to attain a distribution of probabilities. Thus the data used for fitting the
#'KDE will consist of a vector of unique mortality rates and their corresponding
#'weights given by the relative exposure.

#'### Bayesian estimation

#' My basic assumptions concerning the distribution of mortality risk in a
#' population of newborns are:
#'
#' - there is no zero risk, the risk must be positive
#' - the distribution of risk is smooth
#' - the distribution of risk has a long right tail of improbable, but high risk
#'   newborns
